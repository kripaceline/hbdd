What i wouldve done without you. Even though its only been like 2 years since we met, it feels like<br>
I knew you since forever. Im honestly so surpised on how close we got within these years. You<br>
impressed me so quickly. And made me fall for you when i was questioning if love actually exists.<br>
I love you so much. I hope youre gonna smile a lot this year. I love it when i see that cute<br>
lil smile on ur face. I wanna see that till i die. I also wanna mention how much you mean to me.<br>
I think ive made it pretty obvious but still. You mean a lot to me. You have access to this<br>
special place in my heart than nobody has ever been too. Consider yourself lucky uwu.<br>
You didnt expect this, didnt ya? Hehe. Dating me is full of surprises you never expect.<br>
Stay tuned for more. Hm.. Is this some typa clue? Is it? Or is it not? Is it some typa misdirection?<br>
I guess you'll have to wait n see. <br>
Anyways, Once again,<br>
Happy birthdayyy sweetheart<3<br>
